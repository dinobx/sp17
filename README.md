# SP17

**SP17** is a silly little macropad based on the optimal solution for packing 17 equal squares into the smallest possible bounding box.

Based on the mathematical packing problem: how can you fit a certain amount of unit squares into the smallest possible rectangle? Read more about the packing problem of x squares on https://www.combinatorics.org/files/Surveys/ds7/ds7v5-2009/ds7-2009.html

## Details

- 17 keys in the optimal packing solution for 17 squares, with options to opt for 2u vertical or horizontal keys in the bottom corners
- MX-compatible, solder only
- Diodeless
- Pro Micro footprint
- Features the 40%s community Logo where this project originated from.
- The Case was designed and optimized for CNC milling, but is also 3D printable. A CNC'd case has not been prototyped before.
- If interest persist I do want to run a little Groupbuy eventually.
